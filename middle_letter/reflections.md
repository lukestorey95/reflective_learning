### Mistakes
1. Only planned half the program before starting
2. Jumped straight to conclusion I needed to round index up without testing it in irb first
3. Should use Google when I don't know what method I need, and DevDocs when I do know but want to check usage
4. Made same mistake about index being zero indexed twice - should have rememebered after first time
5. Mistook which test was failing
6. Read new method values_at but didn't check usage, ended up causing me to use it wrong and have to check the docs again
7. Refactored and ended up writing the whole program again, not the best use of time

### Learnings
1. Plan the whole program before starting
2. Test assumptions in irb first
3. Use Google for looking up what method to use, and DevDocs for looking up specific method usage/syntax
4. Learn from my mistakes
5. Read the error messages carefully, which test is failing, why is it failing etc.
6. When looking up new methods fully understand how they work and how to implement them first
7. Leave more time for refactoring
